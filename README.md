# kil0bit System Monitor v3

> **Rust port development is active on `rust/phase-0`.** This fork preserves the upstream project and its original .NET documentation; the parallel Rust implementation is under `crates/` and does not require .NET to build or run. See [`docs/rust-port/README.md`](docs/rust-port/README.md) for Rust-only build and verification instructions. The Rust port is still under development and is not a replacement release yet.

## ✨ Why kil0bit System Monitor?

Kil0bit System Monitor is a modern successor to legacy taskbar monitors. It’s designed specifically for **Windows 11 power users** who need accurate, real-time metrics without the bloat of Electron or the overhead of high-level monitoring tools.

### 📊 Core Features
- **🚀 Ultra-Lightweight** — Dropped WinUI 3 for a lean WPF + Win32 engine. Tiny binary, zero bloat.
- **⚡ Ultra-Low Overhead** — Uses low-level Win32 APIs and GDI+ for near-zero CPU usage.
- **🖥️ Taskbar Integration** — Sits directly inside your taskbar. Always visible, never in your way.
- **📐 Flexible Layout** — Enable "Snap to Taskbar" for a native look, or disable it to **free-float** the overlay anywhere on your desktop.
- **🏠 High-Performance Dashboard** — A modern, snappy control center built for speed.
- **🎨 Pixel-Perfect Design** — Glassmorphism, Mica effects, and fully customizable themes.
- **🛡️ High-DPI Ready** — Precision rendering that looks sharp on 4K, Ultrawides, and multi-monitor setups.
- **⚙️ Power-User Settings** — Customize sensors (CPU, GPU, Network, Disk), colors, and smart startup behavior.
